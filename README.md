This web app: **"Hub is a social media web application that allows users to create, view, and interact with posts. Users can add a title, textual content, and even an image URL to their posts. The home feed displays all posts, showing the title, time of creation, and number of upvotes for each post. Users can sort posts by creation time or upvote count, and search for posts by title. Clicking on a post navigates to a separate page dedicated to that post, displaying any additional information."**
